- Create a file called `index.js`
- Add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = async (req, res, config) => {
  res.start("<h1>Hi</h1>", "text/html");
};
```

- In the blank space add your own [http module](https://nodejs.dev/learn/the-nodejs-http-module) code, note that you must use res.start to start to send anything.
- Import the module by adding the module to your config file
- Run `npm run start` (or `yarn run start`, if you use yarn).
- It should work!
