1host has many built in methods to allow for you to use multiple modules on a single path.

### `res.start(data, content-type)`

res.start() allows you to "start" a path by giving a string as the content to be displayed and a content-type.

### `res.add(data)`

This method allows you to modify the content of a path.

In addition to the custom methods provided, we also include all of the HTTP module's code.
